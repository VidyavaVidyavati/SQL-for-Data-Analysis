# SQL for Data Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate key SQL skills by querying a realistic e-commerce database.and execute a variety of SQL statements ranging from simple SELECTs and filters to multi-table joins, aggregations, subqueries, views, and index creation to extract insights from structured data.

## Overview
I worked with an e-commerce schema containing four related tables:
- customers (customer demographics)
- products (item catalog and prices)
- orders (each order‚Äôs header information)
- order_items (line-item detail linking orders to products)

## Database
- <a href="https://github.com/VidyavaVidyavati/SQL-for-Data-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20database.sql">Database</a>

## SQL Query
- <a href="https://github.com/VidyavaVidyavati/SQL-for-Data-Analysis/blob/main/SQL%20Query.sql">Queries</a>

Using this dataset, you will:
- Filter and sort data (e.g. list customers in a given state, products under a price threshold).
- Combine tables via INNER and LEFT JOINs to see which customers placed which orders, and what products they bought.
- Summarize using aggregate functions (SUM, AVG) and GROUP BY to compute totals and averages.
- Nest queries with subqueries to answer questions like ‚ÄúWhich customers have orders above $2,000?‚Äù
- Encapsulate logic in a VIEW to produce a reusable customer-order summary.
- Optimize performance by adding indexes on frequently joined columns.

## üéØLearning Outcomes
- Writing basic and advanced SQL queries.
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
- Joining multiple tables to combine related data.
- Using subqueries and views for modular analysis.
- Applying indexes to improve query performance.
